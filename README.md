This is just a little fun sort I made based on a tweet that a friend sent me.

The tweet:
"I came up with a single pass O(n) sort algorithm I call StalinSort. You iterate down the list of elements checking if they're in order. Any element which is out of order is eliminated. At the end you have a sorted list."

Russian comments have been added for the sake of authenticity.
